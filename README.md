## Stock Market Data Visualization Desktop Application

This document outlines the requirements for a desktop application designed to visualize historical stock market data. 

### Key Functionalities

* **Charting**

  * **Chart Types:** (Describe how the application will display historical data using candlestick, line, and bar charts. Briefly mention libraries or frameworks you might use for visualization.)
  * **Crosshair Pointer:** (Explain the functionality of the crosshair pointer and its interaction with the charts.)
  * **Dual-Window Layout:** (Describe the layout with a main price chart and a smaller window for indicators. Mention potential libraries for creating the layout.)

* **Data Management**

  * **Folder Selection:** (Explain how users can select folders containing historical stock data files (CSV or similar format).)
  * **Multiple Folders:** (Describe the functionality of selecting multiple folders, including NYSE, NASDAQ, or user-defined directories.)
  * **File List:** (Explain how the application will display a list of available data files within the selected folder(s).)
  * **Search Function:** (Describe how users can search for a specific data file by name.)
  * **File Opening:** (Explain how the application opens the corresponding chart when a file is selected from the list or found through the search function.)

* **Customization**

  * **Chart Style:** (Describe how users can choose between line or bar chart styles. Mention potential UI elements for selecting styles.)
  * **OHLC Data:**  (Explain how users can choose to display the Last Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) data points. Mention UI elements for this functionality.)
  * **Moving Averages:** (Describe how users can select and visualize at least three different moving averages (simple or exponential). Mention UI elements for selecting moving averages.)

* **Technical Analysis**

  * **Technical Indicators:** (Explain how the application will calculate and display technical indicators like MACD and TRIX on the chart. Briefly mention libraries or formulas you might use for calculations.)
  * **Volume Charts:** (Describe how the application will integrate volume charts to visualize trading activity. Mention potential libraries or frameworks for volume charts.)

* **Signaling**

  * **Signal Generation:** (Explain how the application will generate buy/sell signals based on user-defined conditions. Briefly mention the logic behind signal generation.)
  * **Signal Scanning:** (Describe how the application will scan the selected folders for opportunities meeting these signal criteria and present a list of potential trades.)
  * **Interactive Signal List:** (Explain how users can select a specific signal from the list and display the corresponding chart while maintaining the list availability. Mention potential UI elements for managing the signal list.)

### Required Skills

* Programming skills for developing Windows desktop applications (languages like C#, C++, Python with libraries like PyQt or Tkinter)
* Proficiency in creating candlestick, line, and bar charts using graphical libraries
* Familiarity with calculating and charting technical indicators like MACD, TRIX, and moving averages
* Basic understanding of stock market concepts and data organization (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ)

**Note:** While knowledge of the stock market can be beneficial, the primary focus is on software development skills.

**Next Steps**

* Choose a programming language and relevant libraries for development (e.g., Python with PyQt for UI and Matplotlib for charts).
* Design the user interface using wireframes or mockups.
* Implement the core functionalities outlined above.
* Test and refine the application.
